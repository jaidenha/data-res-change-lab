                    <p><strong>Dr. Jennifer Walker, Ph.D.</strong> • Age 55 • African American</p>

                    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Former private biotech sector researcher; holds lucrative gene and climate-tech patents</p>
                    <p><strong>Family:</strong> Husband Fabio (49, surf instructor, BS Chemistry UC Berkeley); Daughter Margaret (25, visual artist, adopted from Somalia); 1 Rottweiler</p>
                    <p><strong>Giving History:</strong> $5,000 annual donor to Lo-Do Aquarium; past support for conservation & human rights causes</p>

                    <h2>Your Mission Tonight</h2>
                    <p>You are meeting Dr. Walker for dinner at <strong>Kaimana Terrace</strong>, a quiet uncrowded restaurant. Fabio had an urgent conflict and couldn't attend, but Jennifer assures you they've discussed the materials together.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Goal:</strong> Solicit a <strong>$25,000 gift</strong> for the Aquarium's marine genomics initiative—a significant increase from their $5,000 annual support.</p>
                    <p><strong>Context:</strong> You've been cultivating this relationship for 3 years through lectures, tours, updates, and small events. She's shown increasing interest in the genomics project and recently asked about long-term budget details.</p>

                        <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Met at university lecture → quiet reef tour → VIP dinner with CEO (12 guests)</li>
                        <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Campus coffee meeting → attended Fabio's surf competition → made $5,000 gift unprompted</li>
                        <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Reviewed genomics proposal → attended micro-luncheon → sailing event where she asked about "biggest constraint"</li>
                        <li><strong>Recent:</strong> She explicitly asked for long-term budget and said "Fabio should see it too"—first signal of project-level interest</li>

                    <h2>What NOT to Do</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Don't mention Fabio's surfing clients</strong> - No relevance to the ask</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid too much personal reminiscing</strong> - Could irritate her; she expects purposeful conversation</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't mention their rising wealth</strong> - Unnecessary and potentially offensive</li>
                        <li><strong>Skip casual topics like their dog</strong> - Too informal for a major gift solicitation</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't be long-winded</strong> - She values clarity and efficiency above all</li>
